## Kiosk Mode (Shop Floor Monitor)

**Kiosk Mode** is designed for terminal displays (tablets or large screens) situated on the production floor, providing a high-contrast, full-screen view.

### Accessing Kiosk Mode
- **Dedicated Account**: It is recommended to create a user with the `kiosk` role. Once logged in, this account is automatically locked to the Shop Floor Monitor and cannot access the administrative dashboard.
- **Long-Term Session**: Kiosk sessions stay active for **30 days**, making them ideal for always-on display terminals.

### Key Features
- **Auto-Refresh**: Production data updates automatically every 60 seconds.
- **Smooth Auto-Scroll**: If there are many orders, the display will smoothly scroll to loop through all active work orders.
- **Console Lock**:
    - Click the factory logo in the header to attempt administrative actions.
    - **Secure Unlock**: You must enter the currently logged-in account's **Password** to unlock the console for switching product lines or filtering stages.
    - **Display Density**: Toggle between **Comfortable** (default) and **Compact** views using the list icon in the header to fit more orders on the screen.
    - Once unlocked, the console remains active until you click the lock icon again.

## AI Assistant

ProTracker includes a smart, floating AI assistant to help you:

- Analyze production risks and delays
- Generate daily morning reports
- Navigate automatically to specific orders
- Answer questions about production status

### Using the AI

1. Click the **Chat Icon** 💬 (bottom right of screen)
2. Type your question or use the **Quick Tools** (Admin/Supervisor only):
    - **Analyze Risks**: Identify orders at risk of delay.
    - **Morning Report**: Generate a summary for your daily standup.
    - **Category Diagnosis**: Ask "What are the top quality issues?" to analyze comments tagged with `QN`.

### AI Category Analysis 🧠
The AI automatically aggregates comments by category to provide deep insights:
*   **Bottleneck Detection**: "Why are 5 orders on Hold in Assembly?" (Analyzes `Hold` comments)
*   **Maintenance Alerts**: "Show me recent machine issues." (Analyzes `Machine` comments)
*   **Quality Trends**: "Summarize QN reports from last week." (Analyzes `QN` comments)

### Smart Navigation 🚀
You can ask the AI to take you to an order:
*   "Show me WO-1234"
*   "Go to order 5555"

**Result**: The system will automatically jump to the **Operation View** for that order.

### Example Questions

- "Which orders are behind schedule?"
- "What's the average time in Winding step?"
- "Show me orders with QN status"
- "Summarize today's production"
